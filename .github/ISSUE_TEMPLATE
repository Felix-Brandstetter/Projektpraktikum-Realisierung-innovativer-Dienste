Please include the command line and a test file with your issue report.

If possible, please use a test file that we can include in future test cases (no personal information, no copyrighted material).

If you wish to encrypt a test file so that only the maintainer of OCRmyPDF can view it, you may use:

```bash

gpg --recv-keys 4434eb74c4a35f7f --keyserver pgp.mit.edu
gpg --output test.pdf.gpg --encrypt --receipient 4434eb74c4a35f7f test.pdf

```
